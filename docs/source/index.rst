The SOP-GPU package, where SOP stands for the Self Orginized Polymer Model fully implemented on a GPU, is a scientific software package designed to perform Langevin Dynamics Simulations of the mechanical or thermal unfolding, and mechanical pulling/indentation of large biomolecular systems in the experimental subsecond (millisecond-to-second) timescale. The SOP-GPU package utilizes the :math:`C_\alpha` and :math:`C_\alpha`-:math:`C_\beta` based coarse-grained description of proteins combined with computational power of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).
